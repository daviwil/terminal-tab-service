# Terminal Tab Service for Atom

This package provides a simple terminal pane based on [Xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js), primarily to enable an integrated terminal experience for the [ide-powershell](https://github.com/daviwil/ide-powershell)
package.

The code is based on [Justin Mecham's](https://github.com/jsmecham/) [atom-terminal-tab](https://github.com/jsmecham/atom-terminal-tab) package and may eventually be rolled back into that package.

## Disclaimers

**NOTE:** For now, this package isn't meant to be used as a standalone terminal experience.  It's mainly an experiment for providing a simple, rich terminal to be used by other packages that need an integrated terminal.

**BEFORE TAKING A DEPENDENCY** on this package, please file an issue here so we can discuss it.  This package may be transient so I want to make sure nobody gets broken if it gets removed eventually.
